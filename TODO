* bugs
** doesn't run well on IE 
*** "->string" in test.scm fails
**** might be solved with use of SPOCK.global, but only tested in full block-mode
**** also dies when running test-suite
*** also problems on conkeror on Windows (0.9.3)
** self-build fails
*** expand returns impossible values, somethings deeply wrong
*** recent CPS-fix possibly helps
** large files seem to exceed function nesting on Rhino
*** exits 3, SM previously (before CPS clustering) gave "too much recursion"
*** SM and d8 are ok
*** seems to be a compile-time error

* use jsmin egg instead of jsmin.c

* test suspensions

* compiler
** should have access to original variable names
   keep map of temps -> old names (in state?)
** threads.scm slightly broken
*** inner loop creating threads mutates captured variable

* optimizer
** lifting may result in colliding names, if multiple compiled modules are loaded
*** must be renamed or isolated, somehow
** implement simple inlining of locally bound lambdas
*** this is just cp
*** only for small functions (for example expansion of "(match 1 (2 3))")

* upgrade expander to newer version
** needed?

* count sufficient in user-lambdas?
** or do we have to count in k-lambdas as well?
** bug: zero-argument functions will currently not count

* library
** add section-dependencies
** error-message will be misleading if primitives require mutable strings but get jstrings
** put syntax.scm into library.scm ?
** use case-lambda to specialize single/multiarg variants at expansion time?

* foreign interface
** passing explicit "this" (native-method) not really right
*** perhaps handle %host-ref's in operator position differently?
    needs to generate direct call
** needs complete reconsideration
** "...NAME1.NAME2" could retrieve NAME2 and bind it to NAME1
*** but would need to check at runtime if NAME2 names a function
** test -bind

* runtime
** SPOCK.error should split output at newlines and call console.log repeatedly
*** console.log removes newlines, it seems
** SPOCK.module is still missing

* option "-namespace"
** requires "-runtime"?
** not really tested well

* some dead code is generated after CPS calls
** currently only in `if' forms and after `%continue'

* finish Makefile in "stuff/" to have a working test-suite
